# Kid_GO
Mapbox project for Kid Tourist

I have proposed a solution designed for the young explorers from the age group of 5 to 12 years, making them comfortable selecting a destination to explore from various points of interest nearby. I have also assumed that these kids will be supervised by an adult while exploring these destinations. This application is more suitable for a mobile platform due to the navigation feature required to explore, and mobility is needed to use this application.
